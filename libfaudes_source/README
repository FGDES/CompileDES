OVERVIEW


libFAUDES is a C++ library that implements data structures for the representation 
of finite automata and algorithms for supervisory control within the framework 
originally proposed by P.J. Ramadge and W.M. Wonham. The library provides an 
implementation and evaluation basis for the further development of 
algorithms for the analysis and synthesis of DESs.
