# Compile Discrete-Event Systems to Executable Code 

Once a number of automata have been synthesised to supervise a physical
plant, the task remains to implement their behaviour on a likewise physical device.
For the latter task, CompileDES in that it generates executable code from
libFAUDES automata. At this stage, target languages _C_ and _IEC_ _61131_ _ST_
are supported, along with a exhaustive range of configuration options.

Precomiled binaries/executable are available for Linux/MacOSx/Windows from the FGDES web site.

The current implementation of the code generator is a re-design from scratch, taking into account the experiences gathered in the course of earlier student projects conducted by Silke Figgen (Step7 AWL), Johannes Tautz (IEC 61131 IL), Nicklas RÃ¼ffler (Step7 SCL), Frank Schieber (refined controller semantics) and Jakub Lachky (Step7 SCL and AWL), with respective supervisors Klaus Schmidt, Thomas Wittmann and Thomas Moor.
